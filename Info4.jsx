        Peafowl is a common name for three bird species in the genera Pavo and
        Afropavo of the family Phasianidae, the pheasants and their allies. Male
        peafowl are referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl are referred to
        as peahens, even though peafowl of either sex are often referred to
        colloquially as "peacocks".
