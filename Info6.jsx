        The ibises are a group of long-legged wading birds in the family
        Threskiornithidae, that inhabit wetlands, forests and plains. "Ibis"
        derives from the Latin and Ancient Greek word for this group of birds.
        It also occurs in the scientific name of the cattle egret mistakenly
        identified in 1757 as being the sacred ibis.
