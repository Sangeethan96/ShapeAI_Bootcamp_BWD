      <p>
        Starlings are small to medium-sized passerine birds in the family
        Sturnidae. The name "Sturnidae" comes from the Latin word for starling,
        sturnus. Many Asian species, particularly the larger ones, are called
        mynas, and many African species are known as glossy starlings because of
        their iridescent plumage.
